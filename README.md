# Description
Quick solution of the Foundarium test task

# Features
The task is to:
- Two lists are given. A list of cars and a list of users.
- Using laravel to make an api for managing the list of car usage by users.
- At one time, 1 user can only drive one car. Only 1 user can drive 1 car at a time.

p.s. I got a little carried away and did more than necessary, I hope nothing terrible will happen
